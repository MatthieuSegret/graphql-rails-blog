# GraphQL Rails Blog

This application can be used a **starter kit** if you wish to get started building an app with **Rails**, **React** and **GraphQL**.
This is a simple blog engine using ordinary features which can be found in most web applications.

## Technologies

### Frontend

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It introduces many great concepts, such as, Virtual DOM, Data flow, etc.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - Babel is a JavaScript compiler which allows you to  use next generation, ES6/ES7, JavaScript, today.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- [Redux Form](http://redux-form.com/) - A Higher Order Component using react-redux to keep form state in a Redux store
- [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/) - A flexible, fully-featured GraphQL client for every platform
- [Webpack 2 (with hot reloading)](https://webpack.js.org/) - webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
- [ESlint](http://eslint.org/) - ESlint is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX

### Backend

- Ruby 2.3
- Rails 5
- [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on [Warden](https://github.com/hassox/warden)
- [Active admin](http://activeadmin.info/) - Active Admin is a Ruby on Rails plugin for generating administration style interfaces
- [GraphQL-Ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) - GraphQL-Ruby is a Ruby implementation of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org)
- [GraphQL-batch](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-batch) - GraphQL-batch is a query batching executor for the graphql gem
- [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - Graphiql is an in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL.
- [Rack CORS](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors) - Rack Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which makes cross-origin AJAX possible
- [Optics Agent](http://www.apollodata.com/optics) - Optics Agent for GraphQL Monitoring
- SQLite3 for development and PostgreSQL for production

## Features

- CRUD (create / read / update / delete) on posts
- Creating comments on post page
- Pagination on posts listing
- Searching on posts
- Authentication with Devise and authorizations (visitors, users, admins)
- Creating user account
- Update user profile and changing password
- Setup dev tools
- Application ready for production

## GraphQL Using

- Queries et mutations
- FetchMore for pagination
- Integrating with Redux and updating store
- Optimistic UI
- Colocate data / component with fragments
- Validation management and integration with Redux Form
- Authentication and authorizations
- Protect queries and mutations on GraphQL API
- Batching of SQL queries side backend

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.3
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v6 or newer + [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager
- SQLite3

## Getting Started

- Install Bundler

          $ gem install bundler

- Checkout the graphql-rails-blog git tree from Github

          $ git clone https://github.com/MatthieuSegret/graphql-rails-blog.git
          $ cd graphql-rails-blog
          graphql-rails-blog$

- Run Bundler to install/bundle gems needed by the project:

          graphql-rails-blog$ bundle

- Create the database:

          graphql-rails-blog$ rails db:migrate

- Load sample records:

          graphql-rails-blog$ rails db:seed

- Run the Rails server in development mode

          graphql-rails-blog$ rails server

- Run Yarn to install javascript package in other terminal:

          graphql-rails-blog$ cd client
          graphql-rails-blog/client$ yarn

- Start client in development mode. You should be able to go to
`http://localhost:8080` :

          graphql-rails-blog/client$ npm start

## Next step

- [ ] Upgrade to last version of Apollo. Until now I had to downgrade to version 0.5.21 because of a bug on *updatequeries* ([https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/1129](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/1129))
- [ ] Use [query batching in Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/query-batching-in-apollo-63acfd859862#.dusr3dyde). Until now GraphQL-Ruby does not support this functionality in a simple way
- [ ] Parallelism in GraphQL-Ruby
